
Please look at the changes in to our 6a866a629fa2baf151162e46e34ca45d618a94ea and the notes above to understand what we've done. 

I would like to then re-make these changes in steps on a new branch. I'd like to commit for each separate change after testing to ensure it works.

Please read/compare/figure out the plan first. Then we'll start with the first logical step.

Remember I want minimal changes to my code - but match the new asset paths and make whatever bare minimum changes you have to so my code still works identically to the original, but in a desktop app@PenguinCrossing.java#L1-764

PenguinCrossing Desktop Refactor: Plan and Summary
Based on the code I'm seeing, I understand your goal - refactor the legacy applet to work as a desktop app with minimal changes while preserving identical behavior. Let me outline what's been done and plan the remaining work in logical steps.

Current Changes Implemented
Audio System Refactored:
Created dual-mode audio system that works in both applet and desktop modes
Added centralized methods: playMusic(), playAudio(), stopMusic()
Proper resource handling with debug logging
Player Positioning:
Added constants for player starting position at top middle (PLAYER_START_X = 225, PLAYER_START_Y = 10)
Game Flow Management:
Added restartGameLoop() to reset after failure without showing title screen
Modified resetGame() to properly handle title screen return
Added window listener to handle win screen closing
Desktop Support:
Added main() method with proper JFrame setup
Added runningAsApplication flag to manage behavior differences
Set up keyboard input for desktop mode
Current Issue
The main issue appears to be that when starting the game for the first time, the title music (break1.wav) continues playing instead of switching to the game music (zen.wav).

Recommended Step-by-Step Plan (Each with Individual Commits)
Let me propose a step-by-step plan to rebuild the changes with clean commits:

Step 1: Create the foundation - add runningAsApplication flag and main() method for desktop mode
Step 2: Add audio playback methods with proper desktop/applet detection:
playMusic(), playAudio(), stopMusic() methods
loadClip() helper method
Step 3: Fix player starting position at top middle with constants
Step 4: Add game restart logic:
restartGameLoop() for immediate restart without title screen
Update collision handling to use this method
Step 5: Fix win screen behavior:
Add window listener to return to title screen when closed
Step 6: Fix the current audio playback issue:
Ensure title music stops and game music starts correctly when pressing "Start Game"
I'll focus on the minimal changes needed for each step when you're ready to begin. Would you like me to start with implementing Step 1?


# What we see in the current version
- Intro music "break1.wav" plays, but keeps playing after start button is click -> it should switch to "zen.wav"

- Failing the game (colliding with an enemy) plays "fail.wav" and shows Game Over. Clicking it restarts the game with the proper "zen.wav" playing - but failing again causes "Game Over" to appear, then appear again after clicking it - restarting the game both times. 
    - Enemies get faster and faster on subsequent retries

- Winning the game and closing the win screen should return you to the title screen
